# Top 10 Movies 

Python web application that uses flask, wtforms, requests, sqlite, and the The [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)  to create a personal top 10 movies list. This is a CRUD app that allows a user to search, add, and rank movies and store them into a sqlite database. The site displays each movie's poster, year released, and description.
